IMRT_initialState
0 RestartOptimization - Remove the existing optimal fluences from beams before optimization.
1 ContinueOptimization - Use existing optimal fluences as a starting point of optimization.
2 ContinueOptimizationWithPlanDoseAsIntermediateDose - If the plan dose is valid, it is used as an intermediate dose for optimization.

IMRT_convergenceOption
0 NoEarlyTermination - Always perform the specified number of iterations.
1 TerminateIfConverged - Terminate optimization before the maximum number of iterations is reached if the optimization is already converged.

IMRT_intermediateDoseOption
0 NoIntermediateDose - No intermediate dose for optimization.
1 UseIntermediateDose - Use an intermediate dose in optimization.
